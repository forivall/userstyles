# Bandcamp Dark

A simple dark theme for [Bandcamp](https://bandcamp.com) based on the original work by [aricley](https://userstyles.org/styles/150014/bandcamp-dark-theme-17-10).

## Installation

  A browser add-on is needed to install custom UserStyles.
  I recommend [Stylus](https://github.com/openstyles/stylus), which is available for both [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/styl-us/) and [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stylus/clngdbkpkpeebahjckkjfobafhncgmne?hl).
